# Trio-task

* This is a Flask application that is set up and configured to work with a database and nginx. Write a docker-compose.yaml that will bring all these services up and allow the app to run on port `80`.
* Unlike before, we're using Jenkins for CI/CD. This includes installing Jenkins on our EC2 MEDIUM instance, installing Docker, rebooting instance, and setting up as a freestyle project on Jenkins.
